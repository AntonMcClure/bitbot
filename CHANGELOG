# TBD - BitBot v1.8.0

Added:
- Module dependency system
- Enable TCP keepalives
- `draft/label` tracking on every sent line when CAPs permit
- Enforce version 3.6.0 or later
- 'module-whitelist'/'module-blacklist' in `bot.conf`

Changed:
- Use last `server-time` for `RESUME` - not last .recv() time
- IRCv3: `draft/labeled-response` -> `draft/labeled-response-0.2`
- IRCv3: Prune already-seen messages in `chathistory` batches

Fixed
- GitHug highlight prevention - don't detect highlights mid-word
- Pass already-decoded data in to BeautifulSoup
- !enablemodule actually removes module from blacklist setting
- Only enact write throttling when immediate-write-buffer is empty
- Non-throttled lines no longer delay throttled lines
