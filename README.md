# BitBot
Python3 event-driven modular IRC bot!

## Requirements

## Setup
See [docs/help/setup.md](docs/help/setup.md).

## Github, Gitea and GitLab web hooks
I run BitBot as-a-service on most popular networks (willing to add more networks!) and offer github/gitea/gitlab webhook to IRC notifications for free to FOSS projects. Contact me for more information!
